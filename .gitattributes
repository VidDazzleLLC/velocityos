# Git Attributes Configuration
# This file controls how Git handles various file types during merge operations

# package-lock.json files
# Allow manual merge conflict resolution while recommending regeneration
# Using "text" attribute ensures GitHub doesn't treat these as binary files
# This enables the "Mark as resolved" button in GitHub's merge conflict UI
package-lock.json text merge=auto linguist-generated=true
**/package-lock.json text merge=auto linguist-generated=true

# While the "Mark as resolved" button will now be enabled, it's still
# recommended to regenerate package-lock.json by running `npm install`
# after resolving conflicts in package.json to ensure file integrity.
